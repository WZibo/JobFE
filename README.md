# JobFE

Next.js, React, TypeScript, Shadcn UI, Prisma, Clerk, PostgreSQL

A full-stack job management system that helps me efficiently manage job applications. The project can create, edit, delete, and query positions, including pending jobs, scheduled interviews, and rejected jobs.

The frontend uses Next.js and TypeScript, combined with the Shadcn UI component library to build a responsive user interface. Clerk is used to implement secure user authentication to ensure data security.

The backend uses PostgreSQL as the database and uses Prisma for database operations to support efficient management of job information. The project also implements data statistics, using charts to display historical data of job applications.
